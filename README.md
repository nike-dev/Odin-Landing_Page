# odin-landing_page

This project is an attempt to recreate a pre-defined structure of an html page styled with css. No Javascript will be used for this purpose. 
Through the project, I intend to create a landing page while trying to achieve following things: 
1. Practice and strength the basic foundations of html and css.
2. Properly structure the DOM of the page, while applying relavant styling properties, while primarily using flexible box layout to place 
and align various elements.â‰ˆ
